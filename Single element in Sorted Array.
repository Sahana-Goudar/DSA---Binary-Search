Problem Description
  Given a sorted array of integers A where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once, find and return this single element that appears only once.
  NOTE: Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time.

Problem Constraints
  1 <= |A| <= 100000. 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
 
Input Format
  The only argument given is the integer array A.
Output Format
  Return the single element that appears only once.

Example Input
A = [1, 1, 7] ans = 7, 7 appears once
A = [2, 3, 3] ans = 2, 2 appears once

Approach - By observing we can conclude ans is always in even position, and if first element of repeat is odd ans is in its left side and if it is even ans is in right side.
