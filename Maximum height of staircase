Problem Description
  Given an integer A representing the number of square blocks. The height of each square block is 1. The task is to create a staircase of max-height using these blocks.
  The first stair would require only one block, and the second stair would require two blocks, and so on. Find and return the maximum height of the staircase.

Problem Constraints
  0 <= A <= 109
Input Format
  The only argument given is integer A.
Output Format
  Return the maximum height of the staircase using these blocks.

A = 10. 4, The stairs formed will have height 1, 2, 3, 4.
A = 20. 5, The stairs formed will have height 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Solution

int Solution::solve(int A) {
    long low = 1, high = A;
    long val = 2*A;
    int ans = 0;
    while(low<=high){
        long mid = low + (high - low)/2;
        if (mid*(mid+1) <= val){
            ans = mid;
            low = mid+1;
        }
        else high = mid-1;
    }
    return ans;
}
